title='Terminal file explorer'
+++

I made a terminal file explorer in Python. It has scrolling, file info, and a text preview with syntax highlighting. It can't modify anything though.

I tried to make a modular(ish) TUI system, but it's not great. It does have a cool string manipulation library though.

Better things: 
- [superfile](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile) for a file manager
- [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) for a Python TUI (I haven't used it but it looks good)
