Autochroot is an old project I made in either 2021 or 2022 that automatically makes a [chroot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chroot) environment with the selected binaries and their dependencies (using `ldd`)  
It probably shouldn't be used. There were many problems, like /proc, /sys and other directories not showing up. I had (and still have) very little knowledge on chroots.
