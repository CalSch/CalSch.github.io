title='Graphing Calculator'
+++

I made a graphing calculator in C++ using [raylib](https://raylib.com) and [tinyexpr++](https://github.com/Blake-Madden/tinyexpr-plusplus)

It has a grid with labels, colors, variables, and basic saving and loading, but
it leaves lots to be desired, like a color picker, polar graphs, points, implicit equations, variable sliders, and custom functions.
