CFS is a filesystem thingy I made. I should probably change the name :/

~~Currently you can only create and delete files and directories, so you can't read or write yet, but that's *fine*, I'll *totally* finish this later. I won't forget about this project for months, I never do that!~~

It works now! You can read and write and many other things.

For a better explanation, look at the GitHub:
