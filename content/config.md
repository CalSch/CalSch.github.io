i use arch btw

- [.vimrc](../conf/.vimrc)
- [.zshrc](../conf/.zshrc)
    - [.zsh-settings](../conf/.zsh-settings): zsh settings adapted from the default manjaro config (could be in .zshrc but it is too long and boring)
    - [Oh My Posh prompt](../conf/omp.json) (put this in ~/.config for the prompt to work)
- [kitty.tgz](../conf/kitty.tgz) (or use /conf/kitty/kitty.conf for just the main config)
